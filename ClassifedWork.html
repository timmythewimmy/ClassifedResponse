    <h1>Judicial Enforcement Record</h1>
    <h2>Penalex Complicity Code — Filing Reference PX-117</h2>

    <p>
      This document is issued as a formal judicial-style record concerning compliance,
      liability, and enforcement expectations related to the facilitation or support
      of unlawful activity.
    </p>

    <h3>Article I — Jurisdiction and Authority</h3>

    <p>
      Under the authority of the Penalex Complicity Code, oversight bodies retain full
      discretion to evaluate, flag, and process individuals suspected of indirect or
      direct assistance to illegal actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jurisdiction applies universally and without exception once involvement criteria
      have been met.
    </p>

    <h3>Article II — Definition of Complicity</h3>

    <p>
      Complicity is defined as any action, communication, or omission that enables,
      encourages, protects, conceals, or otherwise supports illegal conduct.
    </p>

    <p>
      This includes advisory input, logistical coordination, digital communication,
      emotional reinforcement, or passive acknowledgment.
    </p>

    <h3>Article III — Severity Classification</h3>

    <p class="warning">
      Any verified instance shall be classified as Penalex Complicity — Tier One.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tier One classification denotes maximum seriousness and is treated as equivalent
      to direct participation regardless of stated intent.
    </p>

    <h3>Article IV — Enforcement Procedure</h3>

    <p>
      Upon classification, enforcement review may be initiated immediately. Subjects
      may be placed under restriction, monitoring, or containment without advance notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Procedural escalation does not require consent, acknowledgment, or cooperation
      from the subject.
    </p>

    <h3>Article V — Defense Limitations</h3>

    <p>
      The following claims are invalid under this Code: ignorance, humor, loyalty,
      friendship, coercion, emotional response, or lack of awareness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Statements minimizing involvement shall be recorded but do not affect liability.
    </p>

    <h3>Article VI — Record Consequences</h3>

    <p class="warning">
      Penalex Complicity designation may result in permanent record annotation and
      extended enforcement oversight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Removal of designation is rare and subject to discretionary review.
    </p>

    <h3>Article VII — Final Advisory</h3>

    <p>
      Continued involvement after awareness of this record constitutes aggravation
      and may result in escalated containment measures.
    </p>

    <p class="warning">
      Noncompliance is not negotiable.
    </p>
